    Below we've placed information to best help you plan your travel into Atlanta! Hotel information, 
    popular vacation sites to visit, and our favorite aspects of Atlanta Georgia. 
    
    <h3>
        Air Travel
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        If you're flying into Georgia for our wedding, the closest airport to the ceremony, reception, hotels and
        attractios is undoubtedly Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport - with airport code (ATL). The 
        Atlanta airport is south of the ceremony, reception and hotel block. 
        
        Just a note: Atlanta is a driving-style city, so a vehicle in the form of rental car, car-pool with other 
        visitors or taxis/car service will most likely be necessary. MARTA - Atlanta's subway system - is available 
        and may be useful in certain circumstances, such as getting into Midtown Atlanta or Decatur, so we recommend 
        our visitors research MARTA before taking it. Please see the <a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/">MARTA website</a>
        for more details. 
    </p>

        We have a block of rooms set aside for our wedding guests at the Marriott Marquis in Downtown Atlanta.

    </h4>
    
    <p>
        However, should you not wish to stay in a Downtown Atlanta hotel or for whatever reason wish to stay 
        outside of the wedding block, we would recommend the Hotel Indigo in Midtown Atlanta for a 
        "boutique hotel" experience. 
    </p>
    
    <pre>
        Hotel Indigo
        683 Peachtree St.

    </pre>
    

    <p>
        Just a note: The wedding reception After-Party will be at Trader Vic's Tiki Bar in Downtown Atlanta. 
        Trader Vic's is located next door to the block of rooms set aside for guests at the 
        Marriott Marquis in Downtown -- there is sky bridge connecting the area to the Marriott. 
        We won't even have to walk outside to get between them! It is also about a 2 minute cab ride 
        from Hotel Indigo in Midtown and right below the Hilton Atlanta.

        Details to be added shortly! The Atlanta Braves have away games during our wedding weekend, so 
        Braves traffic won't be an issue. :) Taxi and car service information to come soon. MARTA - Atlanta's
        subway system - is also available for use in certain circumstances (such as getting into Midtown Atlanta
        or Decatur) may can be researched here: <a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/">MARTA Website</a>

    Kate and Jonathan's Recommendations to Visitors - Favorite Restaurants and Frequented Watering-Holes
</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="name">San Francisco Coffee</span>: Jonathan's favorite! Great for a caffinated pick-me up. 
        <a href="http://www.mysfcoffee.com/">Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">Fox Brothers BBQ</span> : Kate's choice for BBQ! Relaxed atmosphere and tasty fare. 
        Don't miss the Brisket, Pulled Pork, Cole Slaw, Mac'n'cheese, Brunswick stew, Chocolate Pecan Pie... so, 
        basically don't miss any of it. It's not our biggest recommendation for vegetarians - mostly meats available.
        <a href="http://www.foxbrosbbq.com/">Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">Highland Bakery</span> : Jonathan's #1 brunch spot. We love the home-cooked feel! 
        Hoppin' Highland, Shrimp'n'Grits, Burrito de Huevos, Fried Chicken Benedict, yum. Three locations and
        bakeshops - Old 4th Ward, Midtown, and Buckhead. <a href="http://www.highlandbakery.com/">Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">The Porter Beer Bar</span> : This is a must-visit every time we're in Atlanta! Amazing
        beer list inlcuding local artisanal and good ol'favorites. A changing food menu to compliment your brew of 
        choice. The staff and servers here take their drink/food duties really seriously. Any questions, they'll 
        help you out. We love The Porter. <a href="http://www.theporterbeerbar.com/">Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">The Bookhouse Pub</span> : A cozy, tride'n'true pub. Inexpensive beer, some interesting 
        cocktails. Recommended : Chili, Chorizo burger, Veggie Burger. 
        <a href="http://bookhousepub.com/">Website</a> 
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">Ria's Bluebird</span> : A great brunch option!! Highly recommend. Full of cheeky character. 
        Chef Ria won the Food Network program "Chopped"! <a href="http://riasbluebird.com/">Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">Mary Mac's Tea Room</span> : Sweet and quite old-fashioned Southern Atlanta.
        Fried Chicken, real Sweet Tea, Pot Likker, Mint Juleps. According to one yelp.com reviewer, 
        if you circle order "all" on your bread order, your meal starts with a cinnamon roll.
        <a href="http://www.marymacs.com/">Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">The Midway Pub</span> : A frequented East-Atlanta favorite. We don't know why, specifically.
        We just like it. :) Good people, good beer options, staples in pub-grub, a large amount of outdoor seating. 
        A pleasant place to have a drink or two. <a href="http://www.themidwaypub.com/">Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">Farm Burger</span> : Ok, so, there are tons of burger places in Atlanta. The pretty 
        darn good ones are ""Yeah! Burger", "Flip Burger", and "Farm Burger"... the latter being our #1 choice. 
        Forget the frills... a downright tasty burger. <a href="http://www.farmburger.net/">Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">The Varsity</span> : This is a Georgia Tech staple and self-celebrated as the "World's
        Largest Drive-in". Started in 1928, the fast-food joint now consists of 1950's decor (complete with car hops!)
        and limited diner-style fast food. Chili cheese dogs, slaw dogs, orange shakes and onion rings. Will not
        break the bank! :) <a href="http://thevarsity.com/">Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">EATS</span> : Just like it sounds. FOOD. And lots of it. On the cheap. Nice.
