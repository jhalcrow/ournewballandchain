    Below we've placed information to best help you plan your travel into Atlanta! Hotel information, 
    popular vacation sites to visit, and our favorite aspects of Atlanta Georgia. 
    
    <h3>
        Air Travel
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        If you're flying into Georgia for our wedding, the closest airport to the ceremony, reception, hotels and
        attractios is undoubtedly Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport - with airport code (ATL). The 
        Atlanta airport is south of the ceremony, reception and hotel block. 
        
        Just a note: Atlanta is a driving-style city, so a vehicle in the form of rental car, car-pool with other 
        visitors or taxis/car service will most likely be necessary. MARTA - Atlanta's subway system - is available 
        and may be useful in certain circumstances, such as getting into Midtown Atlanta or Decatur, so we recommend 
        our visitors research MARTA before taking it. Please see the <a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/">MARTA website</a>
        for more details. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Hotel Information
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        We have a block of rooms set aside for our wedding guests at the Marriott Marquis in Downtown Atlanta. 
        Please call (404) 521-0000 to book your room for Collison/Halcrow wedding if you would like to stay in 
        the reserved block. 
    </p>

    <p>
        However, should you not wish to stay in a Downtown Atlanta hotel or for whatever reason wish to stay 
        outside of the wedding block, we would recommend the Hotel Indigo in Midtown Atlanta for a 
        "boutique hotel" experience. 
    </p>
    
    <pre>
        Hotel Indigo
        683 Peachtree St. 
        Atlanta, GA 30308

    <p>
        Just a note: The wedding reception After-Party will be at Trader Vic's Tiki Bar in Downtown Atlatna. 
        Trader Vic's is located next door to the block of rooms set aside for guests at the 
        Marriott Marquis in Downtown Atlanta -- there is sky bridge connecting the area to the Marriott. 
        We won't even have to walk outside to get between them! It is also about a 2 minute cab ride 
        from Hotel Indigo in Midtown and right below the Hilton Atlanta. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>
        Driving Directions
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Details to be added shortly! The Atlanta Braves have away games during our wedding weekend, so 
        Braves traffic won't be an issue. :) Taxi and car service information to come soon. MARTA - Atlanta's
        subway system - is also available for use in certain circumstances (such as getting into Midtown Atlanta
        or Decatur) may can be researched here: <a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/">MARTA Website</a>

</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="name">San Francisco Coffee</span>: Jonathan's favorite! Great for a caffinated pick-me up.

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">Fox Brothers BBQ</span> : Kate's choice for BBQ! Relaxed atmosphere and tasty fare. 
        Don't miss the Brisket, Pulled Pork, Cole Slaw, Mac'n'cheese, Brunswick stew, Chocolate Pecan Pie... so, 
        basically don't miss any of it. It's not our biggest recommendation for vegetarians - mostly meats available.

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">Highland Bakery</span> : Jonathan's #1 brunch spot. We love the home-cooked feel! 
        Hoppin' Highland, Shrimp'n'Grits, Burrito de Huevos, Fried Chicken Benedict, yum. Three locations and
        bakeshops - Old 4th Ward, Midtown, and Buckhead. <a href="http://www.highlandbakery.com/">HIGHLAND Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <span class="name">The Porter Beer Bar</span> : This is a must-visit every time we're in Atlanta! Amazing
        beer list inlcuding local artisanal and good ol'favorites. A tasty food menu to compliments your brew of 
        choice. The staff and servers here take their drink/food duties really seriously. Any questions, they'll 
        help you out. We love The Porter. <a href="http://www.theporterbeerbar.com/">PORTER Website</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>

    <li>
        <span class="name">The Midway Pub</span> : A frequented East-Atlanta favorite. We don't know why, specifically.

        darn good ones are ""Yeah! Burger", "Flip Burger", and "Farm Burger"... the latter being our #1 choice. 
        Less frills... a downright tasty burger. <a href="http://www.farmburger.net/">FARM BURGER Website</a>

    <li>
        <span class="name">The Varsity</span> : This is a Georgia Tech staple and self-celebrated as the "World's
        Largest Drive-in". Started in 1928, the fast-food joint boasts of 1950's decor complete with car hops
        and limited diner-style fast food. Chili cheese dogs, slaw dogs, orange shakes and onion rings. Will not
