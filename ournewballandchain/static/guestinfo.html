    Below we've placed information to best help you plan your travel into Atlanta! Hotel information, 
    popular vacation sites to visit, and our favorite aspects of Atlanta Georgia. 
    
    <h3>
        Air Travel
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        If you're flying into Georgia for our wedding, the closest airport to the ceremony, reception, hotels and
        attractios is undoubtedly Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport - with airport code (ATL). The 
        Atlanta airport is south of the ceremony, reception and hotel block.  
    </p>
    
    <h3>

        However, should you not wish to stay in a Downtown Atlanta hotel or for whatever reason wish to stay 
        outside of the wedding block, we would recommend the Hotel Indigo in Midtown Atlanta for a 
        "boutique hotel" experience.
