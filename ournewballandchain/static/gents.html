    I've had so many great friends in my life that just picking out a few as groomsmen was rough. 
    Below are just of few of great people I've been honored to count as friends.
            
    <ul class="people">
    
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/james_halcrow.jpg"></div>
        <h5>James Halcrow, Best Man</h5>
     
        Brother of the Groom, lead singer for 
        <a href="http://www.wizardsmoke.net">Wizard Smoke</a>, and inventor of "Fancy Sauce."
        My best friend since I can remember, James has always been there to help
        me remember that nobody is ever above getting made fun of mercilessly.
    </li>
    
    <li>
       <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/chris_boedeker_close.jpg"></div>
       <h5>Chris Boedeker</h5>
        Master of carpentry, poker, and the sweet science of the buffalo wing. 
        Chris and I met in high school and have been planning world domination since.
        So far our efforts have been mostly unsuccessful.
        
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/matt_bishop.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Matt Bishop</h5> 
        Marine, talented writer and co-founder of the Mt. Freedom initiative - our
        master plan to claim the title of world's largest mountain for the United States.
        Without Matt, Kate &amp; I never would have met.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/steve_collison.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Steve Collison</h5> 
        Brother of the Bride, architect, fisherman, and renowned StarCraft 
        player. I couldn't ask for a better brother-in-law.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/zach_michaels2.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Zach Michaels</h5>

        become better friends after I moved to New York. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/sean_sawyer_3.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Sean Sawyer</h5>

        in <a href="http://www.wizardsmoke.net">Wizard Smoke</a> with James.
        He also makes an excellent renaissance festival companion.
    </li>
    
    
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/jake_schauer.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Jake Schauer</h5> 
        Michigander and beer brewer extraordinaire. Jake and I met when
        he started working at IPS, and despite my best efforts, I haven't
        managed to get him fired yet.
    </li>
