    We thank all of our family and friends for such support and love - 
    with a special thanks to our mothers, fathers and the finest ladies 
    in a Bridal Party a gal could ask for! Sending kisses from Kate! :) 

    <ul class="people">
    <li>
        Maid of Honor <span class="name">Jenny Lynn Collison</span>. The sweetest little sister in the world.
        Jenny Lynn is a huge part of my life, and I’m so proud of her.
        I am beyond glad she’ll be with us to celebrate our wedding amongst
        friends and family!
    </li>
    <li>
        Maid of Honor <span class="name">Jenna Brittany Hess</span>. A dear friend since Indiana University
        and Alpha Omicron Pi. She’s got personality for miles, sassy and sharp.
        Jenna’s something of a logistics whiz -- we don’t even need wedding
        planner! ;) 
    </li>
    <li>
        Maid of Honor <span class="name">Kaitlin Blevins</span>. My “midwestern turned city” gal, she’s
        just a doll! Kaitlin spends her time helping others as a social worker
        in Manhattan. I’m convinced she’s a great deal of New York City’s charm! 
    </li>
    <li>
        Bridesmaid <span class="name">Brittany Steff</span>. My oldest, dearest, warmest childhood friend.
        I’ve known Brittany since I was born. Like strawberry cake or sugar
        cookies, she makes you feel like you’re home!
    </li>
    <li>
        Bridesmaid <span class="name">Kelly Kaems</span>. She’s the most splendid dancer and has the kindest
        character. A glowing example of gratitude and love - this Southern sweetie’s
        amazing inside and out!
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Bridesmaid <span class="name">Beth Brakebill</span>. A darling Atlanta gal! I truly cherish her extreme
        intelligence and dry sense of humor almost as much as her strong notions
        of loyalty and friendship. 

    </li>
    <li>
        Bridesmaid <span class="name">Jackie Halcrow</span>. She’s Jonathan’s sister, and I couldn’t be more
        excited to be her sister-in-law! Artistic, family-oriented and fun, Jackie’ll
        put a smile on your face!
    </li>
    <li>
        Bridesmaid <span class="name">Jenny Ann Wasson</span>. Such a spunky, brainy, arts’n’crafty
        Columbia U gal! She chats with Jonathan about Star Trek, with me about
        Art History -- I think Jenny Ann can do it all!
    </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        So excited to have Miss Ayla von Waldenburg and Miss Julianna Rose
        Boedeker as our beautiful flower girls! We are thrilled these beauties
        can join us!
    </p>
        
    <p>
        In addition, I would love to extend virtual hugs to some wonderful women
        who have so supported our wedding excitement and truly assisted our
        planning process. Sherri Collison, Rachel Smeak, Leslie Dillon,
        Kelly Bishop, Stefani Hanson, Marisa Holman, Caitlin Allday,
        Laci Brock and Charlotte Maumus - you’ve helped me in extraordinary ways!
        Thank you for acting as our Welcoming Party!
