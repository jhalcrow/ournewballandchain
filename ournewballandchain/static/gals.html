    We thank all of our family and friends for such support and love - 
    with a special thanks to our mothers, fathers and the finest ladies 
    in a Bridal Party a gal could ask for! Sending kisses from Kate! :)

        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/jenny%20collison.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Jenny Lynn Collison, Maid of Honor</h5>
        The sweetest little sister in the world.
        Jenny Lynn is a huge part of my life, and I’m so proud of her. I am beyond glad she’ll be with us to 
        celebrate our wedding amongst friends and family!
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/jenna%20hess.png"></div>
        <h5>Jenna Brittany Hess, Maid of Honor</h5>
        A dear friend since Indiana University
        and Alpha Omicron Pi. She’s got personality for miles, sassy and sharp. Jenna’s something of a logistics 
        whiz -- she may have a future as a wedding planner! ;) 
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/kaitlin%20blevins.png"></div>
        <h5>Kaitlin Blevins, Maid of Honor</h5>
        My “midwestern turned city” gal, she’s just a doll! 
        Kaitlin spends her time helping others as a social worker in Manhattan.
        I’m convinced she’s a great deal of New York City’s charm! 
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/brittany%20steff.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Brittany Steff</h5>
        My oldest, dearest, warmest childhood friend.
        I’ve known Brittany since I was born. Like strawberry cake or sugar cookies, she makes you feel 
        like you’re home!
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/kelly%20kaems.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Kelly Kaems</h5>
        She’s the most splendid dancer and has the kindest
        character. A glowing example of gratitude and love - this Southern sweetie’s amazing inside and out!
    </li>
     <li>
         <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/beth%20brakebill.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Beth Brakebill</h5>
         A darling Atlanta gal! I truly cherish her extreme
        intelligence and dry sense of humor almost as much as her strong notions of loyalty and friendship.
            
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/jackie%20halcrow.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Jackie Halcrow</h5>
        She’s Jonathan’s sister, and I couldn’t be more
        excited to be her sister-in-law! Artistic, family-oriented and fun, Jackie’ll put a smile on your face!
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="personpic"><img src="img/people/jenny%20wasson.jpg"></div>
        <h5>Jenny Ann Wasson</h5>
        Such a spunky, brainy, arts’n’crafty
        Columbia U gal! She chats with Jonathan about Star Trek, 
        with me about Art History... Jenny Ann's super!
    </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        We're also so excited to have <span class="name">Miss Ayla von Waldenburg</span> and <span class="name">Miss Julianna Rose
        Boedeker</span> as our beautiful flower girls! We are thrilled these gals can join us!
    </p>
        
    <p>
        In addition, I would love to extend virtual hugs to some wonderful women
        who have so supported our wedding excitement and truly assisted our
        planning process. Sherri Collison, Rachel Smeak, Leslie Dillon,
        Kelly Bishop, Stefani Hanson, Marisa Holman, Caitlin Allday, Emily Cook, 
        Laci Brock and Charlotte Maumus - you’ve helped me in extraordinary ways!
        Thank you for acting as our Welcoming Party!
