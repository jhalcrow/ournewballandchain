    Thank you so much for joining us on our wedding information website! A note from Kate and Jonathan: 
    
    <p class="swirldoodle">
    
        Dear darling guests!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We are so grateful for such amazing friends and family in our lives. It's difficult to expres how lucky 
        we feel that so many of you wish to join us to witness and help celebrate our union! After meeting in 2009, 
        beginning to date in 2010, and getting engaged in May of 2012, we have felt such love and support. 
        Planning a wedding in this day and age can be full of stressors, but you, friends and family, have 
        made it a genuinely wonderful experience. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Our hope is that this website is helpful to your planning purposes as guests. We know it is complex to 
        travel for functions -- even events as fun as weddings! -- And we are so grateful for you making the effort! 
        You'll find guest and travel info, ceremony and reception locations and times, a blog for news and updates 
        and more at this website. Please let us know if you'd like us to include more information on one point or 
        another and if confusion arises regarding planning aspects. This website is meant to more effectively deliver 
        information to you, express excitement for the event, and to provide helpful hints to make travel 
        and stay in Atlanta in June of 2013 more pleasant. 
    </p>
        
    <p>    
        We will be updating it until the wedding with more details for you as all gets ironed out! 
        We are humbled by your love, genuinely grateful for your gifts of support, and thoroughly excited 
        to celebrate our marital union. We love you! Sending our kindest thoughts :) And a great big hug!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Hope to see you in June!
